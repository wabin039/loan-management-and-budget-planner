Loan Management & Budget Planner System

A professional C-based console application for managing loan accounts, calculating EMI, tracking income & expenses, and generating bank-style reports with proper file handling.

📌 Project Overview

The Loan Management & Budget Planner System is designed to simulate a basic banking-style loan and budget management system.
Users can create multiple loan accounts, manage budgets individually, calculate monthly EMI automatically, and view both overall and individual reports in a clean table format.

All data is stored permanently using file handling, so information is not lost after program exit.
